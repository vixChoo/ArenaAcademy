## Online Learning platform 
> A fun-focused, highly gamified learning platform which offers mini-courses in financial literacy catering to the needs and relevancy of different age groups. The target demographic of this platform will be 13 to 24 years old. Through competitive quizzes and tests, players will be ranked on a scoreboard - aiming to inspire the same fun and competitive spirit as many modern online video games do. Players can be awarded with micro-certificates upon completion of certain modules (or sets of modules) to help accredit the platform as a legitimate place to learn practical, real-world applicable skills.
